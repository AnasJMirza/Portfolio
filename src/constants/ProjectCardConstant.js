export const projectOneDesc = "This is so far the best project I have created with React-js. I use Firebase for hosting, database and authentication. Also i use redux-toolkit that make it easy to impliment redux logic. This time I also used react slick to make a slider on the top. You can login and logout with google and also go to the details page of the movie by clicking. I hope you like it."

export const projectTwoDesc = "I beleive to learn by doing projects. This project created by me when I am learning react basics. By designing this particular User-Interface I learn about the fundamentals of react like components, useState, useEffects and other common hooks. All the data displayed on the UI is not hard-coded but coming from an API call. I use TMDB (The Movie DataBase) API for this purpose. I enjoy building this project cause I have learn alot."




export const projectThreeDesc = "This project is very close to my heart because this was my first project back in 2021 when I started learning react. By doing this project I have come to know the power of components of react. I just made a component and reuse it every where and in just some minutes this project was completed. This is a fully respinsive UI of the well known tesla company."
