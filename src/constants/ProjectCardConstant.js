export const projectOneDesc = "I believe to learn by doing projects. This project created by me when I am learning react basics. By designing this particular User-Interface I learn about the fundamentals of react like components, useState, useEffects and other common hooks. All the data displayed on the UI is not hard-coded but coming from an API call. I use TMDB (The Movie DataBase) API for this purpose. I enjoy building this project cause I have learn alot."
