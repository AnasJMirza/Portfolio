export const projectOneDesc = "Github Readme Stats dynamically generates stats for github user's readmes, After github launched it's profile readme feature I thought I would do something unique and dynamic with new readme resumes so I made github-readme-stats which is now used by many people and got over 1k stars on github within 7 days, and currently it has over 30k stars. it has few cool features including `Github Extra Pins` which allows us to pin more that 6 repos in our profile."
